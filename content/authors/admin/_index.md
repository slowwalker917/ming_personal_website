I am a PhD Candidate in Resource Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am also a Research Enhancement and Leadership (REAL) Fellow at UMass Amherst. I will be on the job market in Fall 2022.

My primary research field is empirical Industrial Organization with a focus on markets for professional services and wholesale electricity markets. My recent research is at the intersection of IO and Experimental Economics, examining the role of reputation on strategic seller behaviors and market efficiency in credence goods markets, such as healthcare services, where sellers are relied on providing both diagnoses and services.
